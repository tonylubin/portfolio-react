## Design ##

Built in React with styles written as CSS modules in Sass, using FontAwesome icons, BEM naming conventions and hosted with firebase.
Designed in a component and container pattern whilst trying to maintain the single-responsibility principle (SRP)
by importing data for the project cards and skills cards from external data files to keep the components clean and DRY.

Built an off-canvas hamburger style menu with transitions.

Made responsive for Mobile, Tablet and Laptop with media queries.

Added external packages/libraries for the typing animation, tooltips and link section scrolling
- typewriter-effect
