## Design ##

Built in React with styles written as CSS modules in Sass, using FontAwesome icons and BEM naming conventions.
Designed in a component and container pattern whilst trying to maintain, where possible, the single-responsibility principle (SRP)
by importing data for the project cards and skills cards from external data files to keep the components clean and DRY.

Built an off-canvas hamburger style menu with transitions.

Made responsive for Mobile, Tablet and Laptop with media queries.

Use of CSS Grid and Flexbox for positioning and reordering of elements for different viewports.

Deployment to Firebase for hosting. 

Added external packages/libraries for the typing animation, tooltips and link section scrolling
- typewriter-effect
- react-scroll
- react-tooltip
- hamburger-menu
