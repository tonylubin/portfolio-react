          Hi there<span className={styles.wave}>&#128075;&#127996;</span>, let me introduce myself briefly, my name is Anthony, and with the aim of becoming a developer, I have successfully completed a software development course with _Nology. The course focused on modern market driven languages, frameworks and tools for web development, during which I learnt to develop responsive web apps with the aim of writing DRY code, primarily using JS and React. I became familiar with the fundamentals of programming by adopting the principles of TDD, semantic html, unit testing, OOP and functional programming that I was taught.

          After my university studies, in London and Paris, I went on to establish my own business in the automotive sector. The combination of being "tech-minded" and the soft-skills gained from running a business feels like a skill-set that is well suited to working in tech, across all sectors.<br /> 
          Working in an ever-increasing technology driven environment it became apparent that I had to think along the lines of "why/how the software program is designed/functions?" in order to be effective and efficient (adapt/evolve or fade away...).
        </p>
        <p>
          This led me to explore the world of coding and, having a passion for exploring tech and languages, with the aspect of building solutions and/or breaking down complex problems down into smaller or simplier processes in that "logic mindest" felt like a great blend of the two in my next career journey.<br />
          Especially, as I believe in the motto of " you learn something new each day ", which the world of tech/code never fails to deliver!
